Penalty Spring Energy for Contact Constraints

This module computes the penalty spring energy for contact constraints between
objects in the simulation. The penalty method approximates hard contact constraints
using soft spring forces that penalize interpenetration.

The penalty spring energy for a contact is:
    E = k_contact * d² (we don't need the max function because the collision detector filters out non-penetrating contacts)
where:
    d = n · (x_b - x_a) is the penetration depth
    n is the contact normal vector
    x_a, x_b are the world positions of contact points on objects A and B
    k_contact is the contact stiffness parameter

The world positions are computed using the kinematic jacobian:
    x_a = J_a * q_a
    x_b = J_b * q_b
where J_a, J_b are the kinematic jacobians for the reference positions of objects A and B (the two objects involved in the contact).

Parameters:
    E_out (wp.array): Output scalar (array of length 1) to accumulate total penalty energy
    q (wp.array): Configuration array containing deformation gradients (12-DOF per object)
    contacts (wp.array): Array of CollisionResult structures containing contact information (see given/object_pair_collision_detection.py)
    contact_stiffness (wp.float64): Stiffness parameter for penalty springs

Contact Information:
    Each CollisionResult contains:
    - object1_id, object2_id: IDs of contacting objects
    - ref_pos_1, ref_pos_2: Reference positions in object local coordinates
    - contact_normal: Unit normal contact normal in the world frame

The penalty energy is accumulated atomically across all contacts to compute
the total penalty energy of the system and stored in E_out[0].
