Elastic Energy Computation for Affine Body Dynamics

This module computes the total, integrated elastic energy for all objects in the simulation.
The elastic energy is based on the Green strain tensor and measures the amount
of deformation from the rest configuration.

The elastic energy formula is:
    Energy = 0.5*k*||F'F-I||^2_F
where:
    F is the deformation gradient matrix (3x3)
    k is the elastic stiffness constant (1e8)
    

The Green strain tensor E measures the difference between the current configuration
and the rest configuration. 

Parameters:
    energy_out (wp.array): Output length 1 array where energy_out[0] stores the total potential energy for all objects
    q (wp.array): Configuration array containing deformation gradients (12-DOF per object)
    volumes (wp.array): Volume array for each object

Configuration Format:
    Each object's q vector contains 12 elements representing the 3x4 transformation matrix:
    [F_00, F_01, F_02, t_0, F_10, F_11, F_12, t_1, F_20, F_21, F_22, t_2]
    where F is the 3x3 deformation gradient and t is the translation vector.

The energy is accumulated atomically across all objects to compute the total
elastic energy of the system and stored in energy_out[0].
