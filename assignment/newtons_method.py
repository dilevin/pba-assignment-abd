Newton's Method for Nonlinear Optimization

This module implements Newton's method for solving nonlinear optimization problems
in the context of Affine Body Dynamics (ABD) simulation. The method iteratively
solves the system H * Δq = -g where H is the Hessian matrix and g is the gradient
vector to find the optimal configuration q.

The implementation includes:
- Conjugate gradient (CG) solver for the linear system (use warp.optim.linear.cg with tol = 1e-5 and maxiter = 50)
- Diagonal preconditioning for improved convergence (use warp.optim.linear.preconditioner with 'diag')
- Backtracking line search for step size control (max 5 line search iterations)
- Support for constrained optimization via projection matrices (see given/fixed_dof_projection.py)

Parameters:
    q (torch.Tensor): Current configuration vector (flattened 12-DOF per object)
    energy_func: Function that computes total energy E(q)
    gradient_func: Function that computes gradient ∇E(q)
    hessian_func: Function that computes Hessian matrix ∇²E(q)
    P (wps.BsrMatrix, optional): Projection matrix for constrained optimization

Returns:
    None: Updates q in-place through iterative optimization

Algorithm:
    1. For each iteration (max 10):
       a. Compute H = ∇²E(q) and g = ∇E(q)
       b. Check convergence: ||g|| < 1e-1
       c. Solve H * Δq = -g using CG with diagonal preconditioning
       d. Perform backtracking line search to find optimal step size α
       e. Update: q = q - α * Δq

The method uses a tolerance of 1e-5 for CG convergence and performs up to 50 CG iterations.
Backtracking line search reduces step size by factor 0.5 until Armijo condition is satisfied.

IMPORTANT: For line search the armijo condition checks if the energy is decreasing by a factor of 1e-8*g^T*Δq
To avoid numerical issues instead check if the difference in energy is less than 1e-1
