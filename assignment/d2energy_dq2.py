"""
Hessian Matrix of Elastic Energy for Affine Body Dynamics

This module computes the Hessian matrix (second derivatives) of elastic energy
with respect to the configuration parameters q for each object. The Hessian
matrix is essential for Newton's method optimization and provides information
about the curvature of the energy landscape.

The elastic energy formula is:
    Energy = 0.5*k*||F'F-I||^2_F
where:
    F is the deformation gradient matrix (3x3)
    k is the elastic stiffness constant (1e8)

Parameters:
    H_out (wp.array): Output array storing Hessian matrices (12x12 per object)
    q (wp.array): Configuration array containing deformation gradients (12-DOF per object)
    volumes (wp.array): Volume array for each object

Configuration Format:
    Each object's q vector contains 12 elements representing the 3x4 transformation matrix:
    [F_00, F_01, F_02, t_0, F_10, F_11, F_12, t_1, F_20, F_21, F_22, t_2]
    where F is the 3x3 deformation gradient and t is the translation vector.

The Hessian matrix is symmetric and positive definite for stable elastic materials,
making it suitable for use in Newton's method optimization algorithms.
