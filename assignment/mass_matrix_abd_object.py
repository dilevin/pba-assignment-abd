Mass Matrix Computation for Affine Body Dynamics Objects

This module computes the mass matrix for affine body objects using Green's theorem
to integrate over triangular mesh elements. The mass matrix relates the kinetic
energy to the configuration velocities and is essential for dynamic simulation.

For an affine body with configuration q = [F_00, F_01, F_02, t_0, F_10, F_11, F_12, t_1, F_20, F_21, F_22, t_2],
the kinetic energy is:
    T = (1/2) * q^T * M * q
where M is the 12x12 mass matrix.

The mass matrix is computed by integrating over the object's volume:
    M = ρ * ∫ J^T * J dV
where:
    ρ is the material density
    J is the kinematic jacobian matrix
    The integral is computed using Green's theorem over triangular elements

For each triangle, the integral is computed analytically using polynomial
integration formulas (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system). The mass matrix has a block-diagonal structure with
three 4x4 blocks corresponding to the x, y, and z components of motion.

Parameters:
    M_out (wp.array2d): Output 12x12 mass matrix
    vol_out (wp.array): Output array to store the total volume
    vertices (wp.indexedarray): Indexed array of triangle vertices (3 vertices per triangle)
    rho (wp.float64): Material density

Triangle Processing:
    Each thread processes one triangle. The vertices are accessed as:
    - v0 = vertices[3*tid]
    - v1 = vertices[3*tid+1] 
    - v2 = vertices[3*tid+2]

The mass matrix contributions are accumulated atomically across all triangles
to compute the total mass matrix for the object.
