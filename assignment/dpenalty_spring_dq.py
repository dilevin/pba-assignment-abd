Gradient of Penalty Spring Energy for Contact Constraints

This module computes the gradient of penalty spring energy with respect to the
configuration parameters q for contact constraints between objects. The gradient
provides the forces that prevent interpenetration between objects.

The penalty spring energy for a contact is:
    E = k_contact * d² (we don't need the max function because the collision detector filters out non-penetrating contacts)
where:
    d = n · (x_b - x_a) is the penetration depth
    n is the contact normal vector
    x_a, x_b are the world positions of contact points

Parameters:
    g_out (wp.array): Output array storing gradient vectors (12-DOF per object)
    q (wp.array): Configuration array containing deformation gradients (12-DOF per object)
    contacts (wp.array): Array of CollisionResult structures containing contact information (see given/object_pair_collision_detection.py)
    contact_stiffness (wp.float64): Stiffness parameter for penalty springs

Contact Information:
    Each CollisionResult contains:
    - object1_id, object2_id: IDs of contacting objects
    - ref_pos_1, ref_pos_2: Reference positions in object local coordinates
    - contact_normal: Unit normal vector pointing from object1 to object2

The gradient contributions are accumulated atomically for each object involved
in contacts, providing the total contact forces acting on each object.
